# Chess_Timer
A simple Chess Timer on Android to enable home players get a feel of professional chess.

Concept:

A chess clock consists of two adjacent clocks with buttons to stop one clock while starting the other, so that the two clocks never run simultaneously.[1] Chess clocks are used in chess and other two-player games where the players move in turn. 
The purpose is to keep track of the total time each player takes for their own moves, and ensure that neither player overly delays the game. 

Timing methods are not implemented yet, only countdown timers are implemented. All suggestions and improvements are welcomed.
